# put your "I would have done this with more time"-style comments here

Task 3 - I would have liked to have added some error handling for if a user inputs an invalid entry for example.

Task 4 - Some more time to learn styling! This is my first time using MUI, I really like it but would need some extra time to work out all the props and components.

I didnt get to task 5, but if I had time, I would have tried React UseMemo, or I would have saved data to a state and checked against that before sending the request.
